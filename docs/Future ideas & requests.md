# Future ideas and players' requests

## Galatea

- 1.21 support with CT 3.0
  - Depends on migration of CT itself, and other modules from "requires" section

## Fishing profit tracker

- Option to right align the tracker (and others too)
- Option to render icons instead of item names
- Option to decrease elapsed time in Fishing Profit Tracker (when user forgot to stop tracker being afk)
- Track scavenged coins in Fishing Profit Tracker

- Calculate pet price in Fishing Profit Tracker as difference between lvl 1 and lvl 100
  - Also, there are requests to track pet level progress in coins
- Find out price calculation for Kuudra Keys
- Total and session tracker, or ability to load named session
- Rewrite way to ignore compacted loot in profit tracker
- Profit tracker causes lags after a while (memory consumption grows)
- [Bug] Some items are tracked by Fishing Profit Tracker when dropped, but drop was prevented by SB settings (basically it drops and picks up again).
- [Bug] Trading with other players adds items to the profit trackers.
- [Bug] Adding a Pet to tracker does not increase earned money.

## Treasure tracker

- Minimal functionality: count Good, Great & Outstanding catches
- Ideally, count all catches, and show percent of each type

## Deployables

- Allow vieweing other players deployables in the overlay. Does someone need it?

## Party commands

- !feeshsincejawbus
- !feeshsincethunder
- !feeshsinceyeti
- !feeshsincereindrake
- !feeshsincevial
- !feeshvials
- !kdr - kills/deaths rate for thunder/jawbus [requires API key and custom backend]

## Alerts & chat

  - Sounds folder: assets
  - Ability to open folder from settings
  - Ability to test sound from settings
  - Toggle setting to enable customization
- Multiple drops that happen at the same time lead to "You're sending messages too fast" error.

## Other

- Glowing outline / highlight rare sea creatures (make this not visible through walls) - I want to get rid of SH for that, and replicate this feature in module.
- PogData resets data file on PC crash - consider doing regular backups / research tska library as replacement for PogData

- Rain/Thunder widget

"can you add a golden fish timer tracker into this? i only have golden fish diamond left and i like playing other games while just having my bobber in lava, and setting a 15min timer every time is p annoying lmao"
