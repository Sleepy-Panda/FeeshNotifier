# Future ideas and players' requests

## Galatea

- 1.21 support with CT 3.0
  - Depends on migration of CT itself, and other modules from "requires" section

## Fishing profit tracker

- Track Agatha tickets / Forest Essence on Galatea based on contest results.
- Use drop # in the chat message based on current profit tracker.
- Option to right align the tracker (and others too)
- Option to render icons instead of item names
- Option to decrease elapsed time in Fishing Profit Tracker (when user forgot to stop tracker being afk)
- Track scavenged coins in Fishing Profit Tracker
- Track Ice Essence drop from mobs in Fishing Profit Tracker
- Track pet level progress in coins while it's not maxed
- Find out price calculation for Kuudra Keys
- Total and session tracker, or ability to load named session
- Rewrite way to ignore compacted loot in profit tracker
- [Bug] Some items are tracked by Fishing Profit Tracker when dropped, but drop was prevented by SB settings (basically it drops and picks up again).
- [Bug] Trading with other players adds items to the profit trackers.
- [Bug] Adding a Pet to tracker does not increase earned money.

## Deployables

- Allow viewing other players deployables in the overlay. Does someone need it?
- Overflux and its variations

## Party commands

- Commands should have a cooldown so people do not spam.
- Triggers from pchat only so Vadim does not mute people for spamming in gchat :skull:
- Ability to disable commands in settings.
- Does not trigger if the overlay is disabled in settings.

- !feesh profit - shows Total profit, elapsed time & profit/h
- !feesh profit <item name> - shows amount of the item in profit tracker (may use partial item name, case-insensitive)
- !feesh sc <mob name> - shows amount of the SC in Sea creatures tracker, percent and double hook statistics
- !feesh since <mob name> - shows since from the active tracker, e.g. Wiki Tiki, Reindrake, Lord Jawbus, etc
- !feesh sc/h - shows sea creatures per hour
- !feeshsincevial
- !feesh vials

- !kdr - kills/deaths rate for thunder/jawbus [requires API key and custom backend]
- /feeshkdr <player> - to check myself or someone privately without sending to the party chat [requires API key and custom backend]

## Alerts & chat

- Rare Catch alert based on Skyhanni message does not work for The Loch Emperor (because they send The Sea Emperor in message)
- Rare SC cocooned alert
- Phoenix proc'ed alert / Phoenix back alert (same as Spirit Mask)
- Customized sounds for rare catches and rare drops
  - People want to customize sounds for Jawbus etc, individually for mobs and drops
  - Sounds folder: assets
  - Ability to open folder from settings
  - Ability to test sound from settings
  - Toggle setting to enable customization
- Multiple drops that happen at the same time lead to "You're sending messages too fast" error.
- Write smarter logic to detect personal cap alert (20 for CH, 5 for Crimson)
- Do not include baby magma slugs when producing cap alert.
- Attach Vials drop number to the pchat message
- Clean chat for spammy messages:
  - &r&eTry clicking this &r&fThunder Spark&r&e with an &r&5Empty Thunder Bottle&r&e to collect it!&r (31)
  - The Pocket Black Hole isn't effective against Snapping Turtle! (2) 
  - &r&cThe Pocket Black Hole isn't effective against Guardian Defender!&r
